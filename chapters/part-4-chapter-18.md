Fifty years later, and the times they are still a-changin’. Back in the 1960s, the battle being fought was about freedom, individuality, and expression. Today’s battle is about openness, transparency, and engagement. Citizens are demanding more from their public servants than ever before—and at all levels of government. Not only do we expect our governments to provide ever-increasing levels of service to us at ever-decreasing costs, but we also want to be part of that process. The cry to rid government of waste, fraud, and abuse has been encouraged by sound-bite politics. We need to understand how our government agencies are performing, where they could be doing better, and how they can improve. We want to help influence that conversation and know that action-oriented decisions are being executed. We expect to see measurable results and want to feel the effects of those improvements in our everyday lives. We’re like the shareholders of a public corporation that want to hold our executive leadership accountable for achieving our corporate goals.

50年過去了，改變仍在發生。回顧1960年代，戰爭為的是自由、獨立和表述。今天的戰爭為的則是開放、透明和合作。現在，各層級的政府公僕比過去更加受到公民的需要。我們不只期待政府能夠用更有效率的行政成本提供市民更好的服務水準，同時也希望能參與這樣的流程。輿論持續呼籲政府能擺脫浪費、欺瞞和濫用。我們需要了解政府人員的績效表現、他們是否還有進步的空間？他們該如何改善？我們想要協助這樣的對談，並想確認行動面的各種決策有被落實。我們預期要看到量化的結果，並想在日常生活中感受到這些改變帶來的進步。我們就像是一家大型公開公司的股東，想要在達成公司目標的過程中掌握自己應有的主導權。

We are experiencing a radical transformation in the volume of public data available today and the velocity and means at which it is delivered to citizens. For example, the International Open Government Dataset Search web page (Tetherless World Constellation International, 2013) lists 1,028,054 datasets in forty-three countries, containing 192 catalogs and 2,460 categories of datasets. How are local government leaders responding to this phenomenon as it relates to measuring and improving operational performance? What benefits do they hope to achieve from this transparency? What does the future of local government leadership look like in terms of managing better and driving improved performance? And, how does collaboration of performance results and sharing of best practices across cities support that future vision?

現在我們正經歷一場對公眾資料的劇烈改革，包括資料的可用性，以及資料提供給民眾的速度和方式。例如，國際開放政府資料集搜尋網(International Open Government Dataset Search web, Tetherless World Constellation International, 2013)列出了43個國家共 1,02,054組資料集，包含192種目錄和2,460種分類。如果這和營運績效的評鑑和改善有關的話，地方政府的負責人要如何因應這個現象？從這樣的資料透明度，他們希望能得到什麼效益？在改善管理和提高績效方面，地方政府的領導地位在未來會發生什麼改變？還有，如何將這些績效成果和成功典範的分享透過跨城市的合作以達到願景的目標？

This essay explores how transparency and collaboration in the municipal performance management process leads to increased engagement, better-run government, and improved outcomes for citizens. First, we’ll provide some background on what performance management in the public sector is and why we do it. Second, we’ll discuss accountability and transparency to the public and share insights from real cities doing this today. Finally, we’ll talk about how open data can be leveraged across and among cities to provide context and insight that inform the performance improvement agenda. We’ll learn how, despite our preconceived notions, cities large and small are openly collaborating to help each other improve.

這篇文章探索市政績效管理如何經由透明和協同過程，提高了顧用、政府營運績效，並改善為市民的服務成果。首先，我們會將公領域有哪些績效管理以及為什麼需要這些管理的背景做個說明。其次，我們會以目前實際的例子討論有些城市當責地對市民透明的分享洞察分析。最後，我們會談到開放資料如何能在各城市間被借勢來提供績效改善議題的內容和洞察報告。從中我們會了解，儘管有些先入為主的觀念，但大城市和小城市是開放地合作，並互相協助改善。

Let’s start by getting a baseline understanding of what performance management is and why we do it.

讓我們從基績管理是什麼，與為什麼要做這件事來當做入門的開始吧。

### What Is Performance Management?
### 什麼是績效管理？


Performance management, specifically as it relates to the public sector, is a management system to improve the delivery of services using quantified measurements that are collected and reported to focus attention and action on areas of organizational performance in need of improvement.

績效管理，特別是在公領域上，是針對需要改進的組織面成效，著眼在量化評估的收集和報告，以改善服務遞送水準的管理系統。

Performance management is, first of all, a management system. While this statement may appear obvious, another commonly used term, “performance measurement,” obscures the focus of performance management. Performance management is action-oriented, although quantitative measurement to monitor the effectiveness of the delivery of public services remains a core component. It is the periodic and routine management review of these ongoing measures that leads to new initiatives, reallocation of resources, modification of service processes and policies, and anything else that improves the service delivery of our government.

「績效管理」基本上就是一種管理系統。這句話看起來很直白，而通常我們會被「績效評估」 這個字眼掩蓋了績效管理的重點。即使量化的評估仍是公眾服務水準效率監督的核心，但績效管理的本質是行動導向的。也正是透過這些持續性的定期管理檢討，才能帶出新措施、資源重分配、服務流程或政策的修正、和其他所有改善我們政府服務傳遞的行動。

A key first step to a successful performance management process is to make sure we are measuring the right things—the issues that matter to citizens. We call these “outcomes.” Outcomes typically come in two forms—outcomes of effectiveness (doing things better) and outcomes of efficiency (being more cost-effective at doing so). One advantage of measuring outcomes is that, unlike department operations or business processes that may change over time, the outcomes that citizens desire do not. This allows us to define a long-term vision for improvement and develop a roadmap that gets us there.

想要績效管理的流程能成功，第一件要緊事就是要確認你追蹤或評量的東西是正確的 - 例如和市民切身相關的議題，也可以說是「產出」。產出通常以兩種型態呈現：「有效果」（把事情做對）或是「有效率」（提高速度或降低成本）。直接針對「產出」做評估的好處是：不像部門運作或事務流程這類會隨著時間改變的因子，市民對於產出的期待是不變的。因此，更容易定出長期的願景和藍圖，以便追蹤、改善，直到達成目標。

There is a growing emphasis on asking citizens what is important to them, and in doing so, we often learn that our initial assumptions are off. San Francisco learned from citizen surveys that perceptions of street and sidewalk cleanliness were affected by foul odors. Bellevue, Washington, developed a set of sixteen “vital signs,” then used focus groups to validate those vital signs. Bellevue’s departments thought that the things they do most frequently were most important, but the public felt that the most severe outcomes were most important. For example, the police department focused on less severe crimes that occur more often, but the public apparently cared more about the most serious, though less frequent, crimes.

重點是，要不斷去了解市民覺得什麼是重要的。藉此，我們才會知道之前的假設可能都搞錯了。舊金山從市民調查了解到，市民對街道或人行道的清潔度的感受主要是取決於臭味。華盛頓州的貝爾維尤，開發了一組16種「活力指標」，並透過焦點團體去驗證這些指標。貝爾維尤的公部門以為他們天天都在進行的工作很重要，但是大眾覺得最重要的事其實是較嚴重的偶發性事件。例如，警察局把焦點放在頻繁發生的輕微犯罪事件上，但大眾顯然比較在乎的是嚴重的犯罪事件，即使這類事件發生的頻率較低。

Measuring outcomes of effectiveness and efficiency is much more meaningful than simply measuring activity. Counting how many potholes we filled last month doesn’t tell us very much. It tells us how busy we are, but not whether we are particularly good at pothole repair. How long that three-foot pothole has been sitting in the middle of her street is something that might matter to Jane Q. Citizen. Two days? Two weeks? Two months? Longer? A measure of effectiveness that matters to her might be the average amount of time that elapses between the reporting of a pothole by a citizen and its repair. We’ll also want to know the average cost to repair a pothole so that we can determine whether or not we have an efficient pothole repair operation.

評量效率和效果的成績，比評量活動有意義得多。統計每個月我們補了馬路上幾個洞並不代表什麼，頂多是讓我們知道自己有多忙，而非我們對於補坑洞這件事有什麼特別厲害的地方。對市民Jane Q.來說，那個在她巷口一米見方的大洞已經多久沒人來修了才是她在乎的。兩天？兩週？兩個月？或更久？對她來講，評估績效可能得基於是從市民通報路上有一個洞，直到那個洞被補好的平均所需時間。此外，市民也想要知道修好一個路上的洞所需的平均成本，這樣我們才能知道這個路洞修補的作業是否有效率。

Once we decide what we’ll need to measure, we need to begin capturing, reviewing, and analyzing the data. Naturally, we’ll need the right technology to do so. We need a tool that can interoperate with the myriad of other systems within our operations. Furthermore, we need the ability to visualize the data in ways that tell a clear story. This tool needs to help us see patterns and relationships, correlate data across departments and agencies, and be intelligent enough to present us with the most important and relevant information, so that even our ongoing performance management process is as efficient as it can be. It should alert us when performance is moving in a negative direction so we can respond accordingly, and it should highlight positive trends so that we know that our actions are keeping us on the right course.

一旦決定了評量的標的，就得開始擷取、檢視和分機資料。理所當然地，我們也需要洽當的工具來進行這些工作。我們需要的是一種能和其他無數種系統互相運作的工具。進一步來說，我們須得把資料清楚透過視覺化來呈現其內所隱含的故事。這件工具還得幫助我們看清公部門間的行為模式、資料關聯和資料相依性，還必須很聰明的將最重要、最相關的資訊呈現給我們，如此一來績效管理的流程才能儘可能的提高效率。當績效有變糟的傾向時，它必須發出警告，以便我們能做出適當的反應，同時也應該在發現正向的趨勢時提示我們，我們才知道我們的行動是正確的。

### Why Bother?
### 何苦呢？

Having an effective, ongoing performance management process in place is the key to running a successful government. Through these processes, management gains increased visibility into operational performance and results. Operational improvements can be realized through optimized resource allocations. It can even spur policy review and modifications.

到位、有效、持續的績效管理流程是成功政府運作的關鍵。透過這些流程，能夠對運作績效和結果得到更大的能見度。並能透過資源分配最佳化而實現運作的改善。甚至還能帶動政策檢討和調整。

Even more important is the fact that introducing these approaches as part of the way of doing business inside local government can establish a high-performance culture within the organization. This creates greater internal alignment by better communicating organizational priorities to the team.

更重要的是，隨著正確的績效管理手法被帶入地方政府的事務流程，還能在組織內建立起一種高績效導向的工作文化。這能進一步讓團隊間對於「優先權」的溝通更一致，進而校準團隊內部。

By introducing open data into performance management processes, we can make great leaps forward in increasing accountability and data-driven communication with stakeholders. That means knowing the stakeholders of local government and monitoring how a good performance management process can properly engage them through the data.

將開放資料導入績效管理，可以對利益關係人(市民)在「當責」和「以資料為基礎的溝通」上建立極大幅度的躍進。意即：深入了解地方政府的利益關係人(市民)，以及監督良好的績效管理流程並透過真確的資料來與他們溝通。

#### Accountability and Communication
#### 當責與溝通

Government accountability is about setting expectations and reporting to stakeholders what has been accomplished relative to those expectations. It is more about the communication of actions and results, rather than the actions and results themselves. Accountability rests on an assumption of responsibility by elected and appointed officials in government to protect and serve citizens and act as stewards of the public’s resources.

所謂政府當責是指對利害關係人設定預期成果並對這些預期的進度進行報告。當責的意思除了行動、結果本身外，更重要的是對這些行動或結果所應進行的溝通。「當責」必須建立在這樣的假設前題下：推選或指派的政府官員之責任，是在於保護及服務市民，並將自己視為是公共資源的看管者。

The four major stakeholders of local government are:

地方政府的利害關係人主要可分為四種大類：

* Department heads, who oversee the operations within each service area.

* 部門主管類，負責監督各服務區的運作。

* Municipal management, who coordinate the different service areas and are responsible for the implementation of policies.

* 市政管理類，負責協調不同的服務區及政策實施。

* Elected officials, who set policy, may have a management role, and are one step from the public.

* 民選官員類，負責設定政策，可能兼任管理職，並且與民眾十分接近。

* The public, either through individuals or stakeholder groups.

* 民眾，包括個人或是利害關係團體。

The benefit of a good performance management system is that objective data about the accomplishments of government can be seen by anyone, even if it is packaged in different ways and in different levels of detail. This integrated accountability promotes rational decision-making because of the commonality of the facts. Staff, management, and the public see these facts through their individual lenses:

良好績效管理系統的好處是，政績的客觀數據可以被任何人輕易看見，即使是用不同的型態包裝或以不同的細節呈現。因為客觀資料所帶來的共通性，使得這種整合的當責促進了理性的決策。雇員、管理階層和大眾都能從他們的角度看見具體、真實的數據：

* Staff: are we getting the job done?

* 雇員：我們的工作都完成了嗎？

* Management: is the job getting done efficiently and effectively?

* 管理階層：工作的進行是正確又有效率的嗎？

* Public: are we getting the results we pay for?

* 大眾：我們納得稅有得到人民想要的結果嗎？

To that last point, we are seeing two interesting trends emerge that support open data with respect to operational performance.

對於最後一點，我們可發現兩項有趣的趨勢，支持開放資料有助於營運績效的說法。

#### Public Participation
#### 大眾參與

First, citizens, in part thanks to technological developments, are taking a more active role in wanting to understand and contribute to the performance of their cities and towns. Products like SeeClickFix, which capture input directly from citizens through their mobile devices, are informing city agencies of service needs in real time and with greater volume than ever before. They allow citizens to report everything, from graffiti to potholes to streetlights in need of repair. However, these new capabilities are also setting expectations in the minds of citizens that these incidents will be addressed on a timely basis. They expect results and feedback. City managers need to track overall performance and response times and report how well they’re doing back to the public, both individually and in the aggregate.

首先，有一部份歸功於科技發展的是，市民逐漸扮演對於城鎮運作績效想主動了解或貢獻己力的角色。 SeeClickFix這類的產品  (註：一個讓民眾通報居家附近有什麼問題、並追蹤修復情況的社群網站，也有手機App 版)，以前所未有的資訊量直接從市民的手機取得訊息，並且通報市政機關。它們讓市民能舉報每件大小事，從街頭途鴨、需俢補的道路坑洞、到壞掉的路燈。然而，這些新能力同時也讓市民有了對於這些舉報要在某個時間內得到重視的預期心態。市民們期待結果和回饋。城市管理者必須追蹤整體的績效和回應時間，並對大眾報告執行的效果，包括個別案件和全面的成效。

The use of citizens or non-government organizations to help deliver public services is known as “co-production.” Co-production can be provided by individuals or by organized volunteer groups. Originally, it was represented by low technology involvement, such as the Neighborhood Watch, an organized group of volunteers trained to reduce crime and vandalism in their neighborhoods. Technology is increasing the potential for citizens to produce services in conjunction with their local governments.

透過公民或非政府組織來協助產生公共服務的作法稱做「共創」。共創可以透過個人也可以透過有組織的志工團體。起初，這是從低技術含量的行為開始，例如守望相助：一群志工透過組織和訓練，在鄰里之間協助預防犯罪。科技的引入拉高了公民能和政府結合產生新服務的潛力。

#### High Performance Cultures
#### 高績效文化

At the same time as it is becoming easier for citizens to identify problems for their governments, forward-thinking government officials, some of whom have been influenced by private sector experience, are realizing the benefits of holding themselves and their organizations accountable to the public. A mayor or city manager instills a high performance culture within his organization when he establishes an ongoing process of tracking operational metrics across departments and agencies—and publishes those metrics to the public in conjunction with the objectives and strategies they are intended to measure. By giving each of his department heads direct responsibility for establishing those objectives, strategies, and metrics, he is driving accountability and strengthening the relationship between citizens and their government leaders.

在公民能夠更容易辨識出政府問題的同時，思維較前瞻的政府官員(特別是其中一些具有在私人機構服務經驗的)也愈來愈了解將他們自己和組織拿出來對公民交待的好處。當市長(或著說是城市的經理人)經由建立一套持續性的運作指標追蹤系統，來建立政府跨部門高績效文化時，這些績效指標也等於得配合著市政的目標或策略方向來制定。當市長將建立目標、策略和衡量指標的責任直接交派給各部會主管，這也正是在要求當責文化以及強化市民與政府主管間的關係的表現。

### How Cities Are Communicating Performance Results With Their Public
### 城市如何和群眾溝通績效成果

To date, only a small percentage of cities have gone so far as to publish their performance strategies and results publicly on their websites. These pioneers realize the value of continuously monitoring performance, striving to improve results, and sharing those results with their citizen stakeholders. Although the processes used to collect, review, and publish performance data and the content and format of the information that is presented vary widely across cities, they all have certain common characteristics:

目前，只有很小部份的城市能做到公開地在網站上發佈它們的績效策略和成果。這些先趨城市理解持續監督績效、力圖改善成果和把這些成果和市民或利害關係人分享的價值。雖然這些城市在收集、審核和發佈績效資料的過程、內容、和格式有各程呈現型態，但他們都有一些特定的共通特徵：

* These initiatives are driven from the very top of the organization, often by the mayor or city manager.
* Performance data is collected, reviewed, and published on a routine basis.
* Department managers are integral to the process.
* There is a specific part of the organization dedicated to the performance management program. In smaller cities, this might be all or part of the responsibilities of a single individual. In larger cities, there is often a department or office of performance management that involves a larger team.

* 發起人大多是來自組織的非常高層。通常是市長這種層次的城市管理者。
* 績效資料的收集、審核和發行是以例行性工作的型態進行。
* 各部會主管是不可或缺的角色
* 致力於績效管理計畫的組織有一個特點，在較小的城市中，這可能是由某一個人來負責。在較大的城市中，通常會有一個較大的團隊組成一個績效管理部門。

In reviewing websites of many of the cities that engage in performance reporting, we found a great deal of diversity in the manner in which these municipalities went about their reporting:

群覽許多進行績效報告的城市網站後，我們從這些城市的報告中發現有非常可觀的多樣性：

* The population sizes range from towns that may have less than 50,000 residents to the largest of cities throughout the nation, including New York City.
* The frequency of the data reporting varies, including monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually.
* Some report performance against targets and discuss the goals and objectives of their departments, while others do not.
* The most commonly used source of data is operational measures, which are collected by the departments, but some of the cities use citizen satisfaction surveys and outcomes based on inspections or other ways of determining results of the operations.
* Several of the cities have found ways to have the public determine what measures are important to them, including focus groups, citizen surveys, and individual suggestions.
* There are no apparent correlations between these diverse factors, such as a tendency for the larger municipalities to report more (or less) frequently.

* 人口數從低於50,000居民的小鎮到國家級的大城市，包括紐約市。
* 資料更新的頻率不一。包括每月更新、雙月更新、每季更新、半年更新和年度更新。
* 有些績效報告具目標針對性，並討論部門的目標和目的，有些則沒有。
* 最常用的資料來源是營運性資料，並由負責部門自行收集。但有些城市使用市民滿意調查，且產出是基於調查研究或其他評估績效的方法。
* 有好幾個城市有一些方法讓大眾決定哪些數字對他們是重要的。例如焦點團體、市民訪查、或個人建議。
* 這些差異間並沒有顯著的相關性，例如城市的大小不一定會和報告更新的頻率有關。

We spoke to officials who manage performance programs from four cities that are widely known for their performance initiatives. The following are highlights of their programs:

我們訪問了四個在績效管理上著名城市的績效管理主管。以下是他們的計畫重點：

#### San Francisco, California
#### 加州，舊金山

San Francisco’s performance program is called “San Francisco Performs.” It is primarily focused on supporting the mayor’s proposed budget and helping to provide context to citizens. Annually, San Francisco issues the “Controller’s Annual Performance Report,” a comprehensive report with over one thousand performance metrics across the city’s forty-eight departments (e.g. Airport, Fire, and Human Services). That amounts to approximately twenty metrics per department. San Francisco also issues a smaller, bi-monthly “Performance Barometer” report on a subset of key measures. This report is approximately seven pages in length and includes a rotating “highlighted measure” and a few of the key performance indicators for various activities, such as Public Safety, Streets and Public Works, and Customer Service.

舊金山的績效計畫名叫「舊金山表現(San Francisco Performs)」。主要聚集在支持市長的預算務及協助提供市民資訊脈絡。每年，舊金山發表「管理員年度績效報告」，那是一份囊括上千種對48個市政相關部會的績效指標所做的詳細報告。(例如：機場、消防、人群服務等)，平均每個部會都有約20項評量指標。舊金山也針對主要指標發表一份份量較小，雙月一期的「績效天氣報告」。這份報告的份量大約是7頁，內容包含指續更新的「焦點指標」和各市政活動相關的少量主要績效指標，例如公共安全、街道與工共工作、和客戶服務。

註：人群服務(Human Service)指的是包括對市民的就業、協尋、兒童服利、老人服務等等從在人道關懷與生活品質相關的社會福利服務。在許多先進國家，政府提供人群服務給個人、家庭或社區，以提升人民生活的品質。

Kyle Burns, Performance Analyst & Program Lead in the San Francisco Controller’s Office stated in an interview: 

在一場訪問中，舊金山管理員辦公室的績效分析計畫首席-凱爾．本斯說道：

> The benefits of reporting performance data to the citizens are all about accountability. Why? Because it’s important. The mayor’s office uses the performance metrics to make decisions on resource allocation in the budget process… Transparency and the idea of having the data published allow citizens to understand how the city is performing and delivering services. (Burns, personal communication, 2013.)

> 對市民報告績效的好處都和當責有關。為何呢？因為當責極具重要性。在預算審查過程中，市長辦公室用績必須透過效指標、以及將資料透明地公佈給市民，並使其了解市政績效和市府提供的服務，做為資源配置的決策依據。

#### Bellevue, Washington
#### 華盛頓，貝爾維尤

The City of Bellevue, Washington, has been, “Managing for Results” since 1997, when the city manager started a performance management program based on two key goals: creating an evidenced-based government and sharing that information with the public via their website. The title they selected for their program, Managing for Results, indicates their orientation to outcomes, or results that matter to citizens. They describe their philosophy with the question “So what?” This indicates their interest in determining why a measure ultimately matters to citizens.

華盛頓，貝爾維尤(Bellevue)市從1997年起就開始做「成果管理」，當時城市管理人所推動的績效管理計畫有兩個目栖：建立施政有據的政府和透過公開網站分享資訊。他們為此計畫所選的名子「成果管理」說明他們是產出導向、重視對市民有意義的結果。他們用「那又怎樣？」這樣的問題來描述他們的理念，其後代表的是他們在乎的是去理解指標對民眾的意義為何。

A cornerstone of Bellevue’s program is to investigate and utilize diverse methods that reach and engage citizens. In addition to using their website for their performance program, in City Hall, there is a board posted which displays the city’s Vital Signs—a set of sixteen key metrics. Bellevue produces an annual performance report following reporting guidelines from the Association of Government Accountants‘ (AGA) and shares this with citizens on their website. They also conduct and report on the results of citizen surveys about satisfaction with public services to complement the operational metrics they collect. Their use of community indicators, which are measures that get close to the ultimate concerns of citizens but may not be totally under the control of any single department or even the city as a whole, is evidence of their sincere belief in communicating to citizens. According to Rich Siegel, Performance & Outreach Coordinator, “We need to let citizens know if we are doing better, the same, or worse. We are likely to get support for projects when they know how well we are doing.”

貝爾維尤市這項計畫的基礎在於對各種能接獲市民或讓市民參與的方法論的探索和利用。除了使用他們的網站外，在市政府，有一個看板公佈著城市的「活力指數」- 一組共16項的關鍵指標。貝爾維尤市按照政府會計協會(AGA)的規格製作一份年度績效報告，並在網站上與市民分享。他們也推動民眾對滿意度的調查和報告，以完備他們所收集的營運指標。他們透過極致地關懷市民，卻非受單一市政部門或整個城市控制的措施，這種使用社區指標的方式，是他們與市民溝通真誠信念的證據。根據Rich Siegel (績效與發展協調官)所述：「我們必須讓市民知道我們的表現是愈來愈好、保持一樣，或是愈做愈差。通常，愈讓民眾充份地了解我們實際的績效是怎樣，民眾才會愈願意支持政府。」

#### Austin, Texas
#### 德州，奥斯汀市

Austin, Texas started “Managing for Results” in 1992. “The core focus of the performance program is to focus on the customer,” said Shannon Szymczak, Corporate Budget Manager. Szymczak continued, “It’s an old saying, but you have to measure what matters.” With over twenty years of experience measuring performance, its performance system has evolved. Austin started with over four thousand metrics, but is now down to one thousand. In 2011, they began to report on twenty-one dashboard measures that were chosen by focus groups of citizens.

德州的奥斯汀市在1992年啟動「成效管理」。「該項績效管理計畫的焦點是客戶」Shannon Szymczak，企業預算經理說：「雖然是句老話，但你就是得去量化產出的意義。」超過20年的績效評估經驗，該績效系統也在進化。奧斯汀市最早使用了超過四千項指標，但現在只剩下一千項左右。自2011年起，他們開始透過由市民組成的焦點團體挑選出其中最重要的21項指標，來做為儀表報告的內容。

Much of the focus of the performance program is aimed at the budget process. Each department is responsible for developing departmental goals to inform the budget process. Since 2005, everything reported to the budget office is made available publicly. Austin emphasizes results by distinguishing performance measures from operational measures, which assess activities. A forward-thinking approach is demonstrated in displaying the results for the past three years in the context of targets for the current and upcoming year. According to Szymczak, “goals must be measurable.”

大部份績效管理計畫都聚焦在預算流程。每個部門都必需發展部門目標以對預算審查報告。自2005年起，每項對預算辦公室的報告都能公開取得。奧斯汀市透過對日常活動的評估來進行營運評量，藉此將其與績效評量區分開來以便強調成效。一種前瞻思維的作法是，將過去三年的成效作為今明兩年的目標背景來呈現。Szymczak說：「目標必須要是可以量化的。」


#### Baltimore, Maryland
馬里蘭州，巴爾迪摩市

Baltimore, Maryland, is appropriately credited as a pioneer of the CitiStat model. CitiStat and all the management methods known as the Stat models share an emphasis on relentless follow-through. Officials accomplish this through periodic meetings in which they review performance and determine action plans to resolve issues. These meetings occur about once per month—or even more frequently in some implementations. The updated results are reviewed in order to evaluate actions taken based on the decisions reached in prior meetings.

馬里蘭州，巴爾迪摩市恰當地建立了城市統計(CitiStat)模式的先鋒。城市統計和其他所有以統計模型為名的管理學方法，都強調不留情面的追蹤處理。為此，官員們透過定期會議來檢討績效並制定解決問題的行動計畫。這種會議大約每月一次，在某些情況下會更頻繁。而為了評估這些決策後的行動效果，事後都會再針對這些行動進行後續的檢討追蹤會議。

The Baltimore Office of CitiStat is a small performance-based management group responsible for continually improving the quality of services provided to the citizens of the city. Staff analysts examine data and perform investigations in order to identify areas in need of improvement. The mayor or members of her cabinet attend the CitiStat meetings, which are held every four weeks, and ask the presenting agency questions about its performance. As a result of its success, local governments have adapted the CitiStat model across the US and around the world.

巴爾迪摩市的城市統計辦公室是一個負責持續改善對市民服務水準的小型的績效管理團隊。負責的分析師檢驗資料和進行績效探勘，以便找出需改善的地方。市長或城市內閣會參加每四週一次的城市統計會議，並對簡報人提出有關城市績效的問題。這個計畫的成功，使得美國甚至世界各地的地方城府採用城市統計這樣的管理模式。

Through the CitiStat program, Baltimore had been tracking metrics internally for many years prior to sharing them with citizens. Initially, department managers had concerns that it might be hard for citizens to digest the information or that it would be taken out of context. Although the CitiStat process emphasized internal management and improvement in delivering services to citizens, the data was no longer being released publicly. The mayor signed an executive order in August 2012 to promote increased transparency. Chad Kenney, Director of Baltimore CitiStat says, “The key is to not overwhelm citizens with a lot of data and to put the data into context so it’s understood.” Department managers understand the detailed data because they understand the service processes. Citizens do not have the advantage of this context.

透過「城市統計」計畫，巴爾迪摩市已在對市民公開前在內部進行了多年的指標追蹤。剛開始時，部門主管擔心民眾不見得能消化這些資料，甚至有可能被斷章取義。雖然城市統計的流程強調內部管理和改善提供給市民的服務，資料卻不再公開的釋出。市長在2012年八月簽署了一份執行命令以提高資訊透明。Chad Kenney，巴爾迪摩市的城市統計計畫主持人說：「關鍵不是用大量的資料壓跨民眾，而是讓資料以良好的文脈呈現以便民眾理解。」部門主管因為熟悉服務流程所以能了解資料的細節。而一般市民取得這些資料卻沒什麼好處。

Baltimore’s public-facing reports include month-to-month and year-to-year comparisons in order to provide a baseline for citizens to evaluate performance. Some of their current initiatives include making this data more understandable by providing neighborhood-based information and working with local groups who help citizens understand the data.
巴爾迪摩市的公開報告包括月對月比較和年對年比較，以便提供民眾一個比較基準來評估成效。一些現行的措施包含透過基於生活週邊的資訊讓這些資料更易懂，還有和在地團體一起協助市民看懂這些資料。

### Lessons Learned
### 經驗教訓

What takeaway points did these four cities, as a group, suggest? How have they addressed the challenges of publicly reporting data?
綜合看這四個城市的經驗，帶來了什麼啟發呢？他們如何解決公開報告資料的挑戰呢18

#### Address Department Concerns of Misinterpretation
#### 擔心資料被誤解

It is common for department managers to be concerned that the public will be critical and misinterpret data because they do not have knowledge of the operations of the city. In addition to providing the public with more summarized information about results and outcomes in order to reduce the misinterpretation, other responses have included:
政府部會主管很容意擔心大眾會批判或誤解資料，因為他們對於城市運作的細節沒有足夠的知識。除了提供大眾較統整、以成果和績效為主的資訊來避免誤解外，其他因應包括：

* Emphasize performance exceeding expectations, as well as performance not meeting expectations.
* Ignore individual data points and emphasize stable trends.
* Emphasize results, rather than activities, to allow the same metrics to be reported, even when business processes change.
* Partner with non-government organizations to present the data to the public to increase their understanding.
* 單純強調績效是超過預期或是未達預期？。
* 避免單一的點狀資料，而強調長期穩定的趨勢。
* 強調結果而非過程，即使事務流程有改變，仍以相同的指標來進行報告。
* 與非政府組織(NGO)合作，讓資料呈現給民眾時更容易看懂。

The balancing act is ongoing: transparency to the public and other stakeholders versus the validity of the interpretation of the data. Perhaps even more important is the perception by department managers that others (including their own elected and appointed officials) do not understand their service area. Hence, some of the responses above show support for the managers’ concerns.
平衡的行動也在進行中：例如對大眾及其他利害關係人的資訊透明，與對資料解釋的正確有效性之間的取捨。也許更值得一提的是，部會主管感受到的是，其他人(包括他們自己所選舉出來或指派的官員)並不了解他們的服務區域。因此，前述的某些回應也顯示出這些主管擔心之處。

Our company, Revelstone, has experienced these concerns with some of its customers. Our practical experience is that leadership needs to support the importance of the data and responsibility of the service area to make its value proposition to all stakeholders. We also found evidence in the four cities we talked to that appropriate data for stakeholders will be different than that used for an internal review of operations in the service area. Baltimore, which built its CitiStat program around a model to promote frequent operational review, has the shortest program of reporting to external stakeholders. More time is needed to see if the partnership with non-governmental organizations will help public use and interpretation of the data or whether it will still need further summarization and a results orientation in the public-facing data reporting.

本公司(Revelstone)，經歷過一些客戶的這些不安。我們的實務經驗是，領導層必須支持資料的重要性以及對服務區域的責任以形成資料對所有利害關係人的價值訴求。我們也在這四個訪談過的城市發現證據說明在對於作內部服務檢討和提供給利害關係人時，要提供不同的資料才能符合不同的需求。巴爾的摩，以促進頻繁的事務檢討為中心建立了成市統計的計畫，其對外部利害關係人報告的計畫期間最短。仍需要更多時間以確認與非政府組織的合作關係能否幫助大眾使用和解釋資料，否則在對社會大眾公告資料時仍需更進一步的將資料統整，並以更結果朝向的型態來呈現。

#### Public Use Is Not Always Extensive
#### 公眾使用不見得廣泛

Most of the cities felt that the use of the data by the public was not extensive. Almost all of them recognized the challenge of presenting the data at a level of detail that would encourage use by the public. To accomplish this, they used dashboards, barometers, vital signs, and community indicators that were a small set of the detailed measures that were used for internal management. Each of these mechanisms focuses on metrics that are most important to the public. These cities are increasingly concerned with presenting the appropriate data to the public—both what they think is important and the level that will encourage the public to spend time learning about how their city is performing.

大部份城市覺得大眾對資料的使用並不廣泛。它們幾乎都認為挑戰在於如何把資料以一個能激起大眾使用興趣的詳細程度來呈現。要達到這個水準，它們用了一些類似資料儀表板、氣壓計、活力指數、社群指數這類內管理的細節量測值的小組合。每一項機制都聚焦在對大眾最重要的數據上。這些城市愈來愈在乎將適當的資料呈現給大眾-包括大眾覺得什麼是重要的、以及多詳細的資料才會讓大眾感到有興趣，並願意花時間去讀這些資料，以了解城市的績效。

One of the major challenges is to convert greater accessibility to data to greater participation and engagement by citizens. The maxim “Build it and they will come” does not apply here. The cities that we engaged with, which are among the most progressive in the arena of publicly accessible data about their municipal performance, recognize the work that needs to be done.
有個主要的挑戰是，把資料更容易取得轉化成讓民眾更主動參與。「準備好，自然會發生」這句格言(譯按，見第20章有關電影夢幻成真的段落)在這並不適用。我們接觸過的這些城市，都是在公共資料開放實作的佼佼者，辦識了它們必得進行的工作。

In addition to the efforts in these cities to increase public use of their data, there is support from a number of non-government organizations that are stakeholders in the increase in public transparency. Some of these organizations include the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), the Association of Government Accountants (AGA), and the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). Their work helps move best practices in public reporting more quickly to other cities and towns.
除了這些城市為了增加資料公眾使用的努力外，還有許多來自同樣為公眾透明付出的非政府組織的支持。包括政府會計標準局(Governmental Accounting Standards Board, GASB)，政府會計師協會(the Association of Government Accountants, AGA)和政府財政官員協會(Government Finance Officers Association, GFOA)。有了這些組織的協助，讓這幾個城市得以將政府資料以更快的速度和最實用的方式為民眾呈現公開的政府資訊。

The interest in performance reporting to citizens has grown in the last decade. Several of the aforementioned organizations provide guidelines to help local governments provide effective public reporting. In June 2010, GASB issued “Suggested Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting.” These guidelines are termed SEA (Service Efforts and Accomplishments) Performance Reporting. According to GASB, the primary purpose of a government is to help maintain and improve the well being of its citizens by providing services.

過去十數年，對市民進行績效報告的效果逐漸展現。前述幾個機構協助地方政府提供有效的市政報告。在2010年6月，GASB(政府會計標準局)發表「自主報告準則建議書(Suggested Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting)」。這些準則建議被稱為「服務的功勞與苦勞績效報告(Service Efforts and Accomplishments, SEA Performance Reporting)」。根據GASB，政府存在的土要目的是透過服務以支持、維護和改善市民的福祉。

Other organizations promote similar guidelines for public reporting and make awards to local governments that effectively follow those guidelines. AGA does this through their Citizen-Centric Reporting Program. The National Center for Civic Innovation recognizes local governments that engage citizens in the performance reporting process. GFOA has put an increasing emphasis on performance management in its publications and recognizes it in its Awards for Excellence.
還有些其他組織為公開報告提出類似的指引，並且對依照準則發表公開施政報告的地方政府頒予獎項。AGA在他們的「公民作主報告計畫(Citizen-Centric Reporting Program)」中執行這項工作。國家公民創新中心(the National Center for Civic Innovation)表揚讓市民參與績效報告過程的地方政府。GFOA也愈來愈重視其績效管理出版品，並透過它的卓越獎(Awards for Excellence)來表彰之。

#### Benefits of Public Performance Reporting
#### 公眾績效報告的效益

The cities we talked to cite increased transparency as a benefit of public reporting. Bellevue believes it is the fact that they are transparent and a high-performing city that accounts for the light public use of the data.
以上談到的城市說明了增加資料透明度為公眾報告的效益。貝爾維尤(Bellevue)相信，輕量的公眾資料取用說明了它們是透明、高績效的城市。

Most of the cities believe that performance data broadens the perspective of the citizen beyond anecdotes and what a citizen observed on a single occasion. Most of these cities also tie the performance data to the budget and state that doing so has enabled them to get public support for capital programs and increases in revenue generation when they were needed.
大多城市相信，這些績效報告能將市民的觀點與視野從小道消息、或單一角度的觀察往外拓展。其中大多數的城市也將績效報告資料與預算綁在一起，並宣稱這樣能讓他們在需要時得到更多的群眾支持資本計畫和提高所需的收益。

### The Multiplier Effect: Inter-City Collaboration
### 加乘效應：跨城市協同

Open data is about sharing and exposing information for the good of all. In the context of local government, this can be about more than just the relationship between cities and their citizens. There are over 39,000 counties, cities, and towns in the United States, along with another 37,000 special districts that run discrete operations, such as water and sewer, fire protection, airports, mass transit, business improvement, etc. Each of these entities working independently to establish goals and strategies, measure and review performance, and share their results with the public are certainly on the right track to managing better. Yet, imagine if they were able to harness their collective knowledge to help each other improve. What kinds of benefits could be achieved in a world where cities shared performance data and collaborated with each other to get better? We call it the “power of the network.”

開放資料談的是所有分享和揭露資訊的好處。在地方政府的背境情況下，這可能不只是城市和其市民的關係。在美國共有超過 39,000的縣、市、城鎮，還有37,000個獨立運作的特區，如供水和排污，消防，機場，公共交通，和事務改善等。這些單位都獨立運作，建立目標、策略、績效評估和檢核，如果把他們的績效成果公開分享絕對是讓管理改善的正確作法。甚至，可以想像他們可以透過協同知識互助來讓改善作業。如果城市間能分享績效並協同互助讓彼此進步，世界將會是什麼樣貌？我們稱這為：「網路的力量。」

A good performance management system allows us to answer three basic questions:
好的績效管理系統得讓我們回答以下三個問題：

* How are we doing?
* What could we be doing better?
* How can we learn from our peers to improve?

* 我們做得怎麼樣？
* 哪些地方還可以更好？
* 我們如何向同儕學習來讓自己進步？

Up until this point, we have been primarily concerned with the process of local governments managing performance from an internal perspective. We’ve also discussed the requirements of any technology solution that enables the capture and reporting of performance data to occur. All of this helps us answer the first question, “How are we doing?” We can also begin answering the second question, “What could we be doing better?” by examining trends in our data—are we getting better or worse? So, how do we gain even better insight into the “what” question and follow that by answering the third question, so that we don’t have to reinvent the wheel ourselves? The answer lies in the two inter-jurisdictional collaborative facets of performance management—compare and learn.

直到此刻，我們有了對於地方政府內部管理績效之流程的初步想法。我們也討論了要擷取及報告績效資料所需之相關科技解決方案的需求。這些能幫助我們回答前面第一個問題：「我們做得怎麼樣？」例如，透過檢驗資料所呈現的趨勢，看出我們在進步或退步？那麼，我們要如何在這些資料中取得更進一步的洞察分析，來回答第二和第三個問題，而無需再從頭來過一次？答案就在藏在跨區協同的兩個面向：比較和學習。

#### Compare
#### 比較

By comparing our measures, we gain actionable information. In providing a context through comparison, we can assess whether we are doing well or not as well as we would like. There are a multitude of contexts and many ways to compare any measure. If we filled ten potholes, cleared ten crimes, or confined ten fires to the room of origin, are we doing well?

透過比較量測結果，我們能獲得可操作的資訊。經由比較來提供脈絡背景，讓我們得以如期地評估自已表現好壞。有各式各樣的脈絡資料，以及對各種量測的比較方法。假如填平了路上的10個洞、掃除了10項犯罪行為、把火場的火勢控制在起火點周圍的10個房間之內，這樣的表現算好還是不好？？

##### Temporal Comparisons
##### 時間比較

The most common context for comparison is to what we normally do, whether normal is defined as last month, the same time last year, or a seasonally adjusted index. All of these are known as temporal comparisons or comparisons over time. These comparisons are available to any government that routinely collects the same data and uses it to monitor its performance. It provides powerful information to see if you are doing better or not.

最常拿來比較的資訊脈絡是我們通常在做什麼。而「通常」定義為上個月、去年同時期、或是以季節調整的指標。這些都是時間比較或是跨時間的比較。這些比較對任何有定期收集資料來監控績效的政府機構都容易取得，而且對於想檢視自己做得好不好能提供有力的資訊。

##### Peer Comparisons
##### 同儕比較

An enhancement to simply seeing if you are doing better is seeing if you are doing as well as others. “Benchmarking” is the comparison of our own measures to the same measures in other jurisdictions and falls under the term inter-jurisdictional comparisons. Benchmarks can tell us whether our performance is better than most others who are doing the same thing or whether it needs improvement just to get in the game.

進一步簡單地看看你做得是不是比較好的方法，是看看你和別人的比較。「標桿法(Benchmarking)」指的是把自己的績效量測值和其他行政區的相同指標拿來做比較，或稱為跨區比較。標桿法讓我們了解自己的表現是不是比其他大多人人好，或是還得進行一段改善才能拿到入場券。

It is important to compare to like peers, that is, other cities that share characteristics related to what you are measuring. These characteristics can be demographic, such as population, land area, or median household income. We look for like demographics because they are correlated with the workload that is encountered when delivering a particular service. In some cases, we can also find like peers by considering service characteristics, which are more directly related to the workload to deliver the service. An example is the number of collection stops for solid waste collection. Service characteristics that reflect the level of service provided also help find like peers. Providers of twice-a-week solid waste collection would not typically be compared to once-a-week collectors.

重要的是要和同儕相比，例如其他有分享和你自主評估項目類似特徵的城市。這些特徵可以是基於人口結構的統計，例如人口數、土地面積、或中產家庭收入。我們傾向使用人口結構是因為這項指標會和提供持定服務時所需要的工作量有關。在一些案例中，我們也可以找到同儕間採用相同的服務有相同的特徵，且其更直接與提供服務所需的工作量相關聯。例如，固體廢棄物收集站的數目。服務特徵所反應的服務水準應與特徵相同的其他同儕比較。每週兩次固體廢棄物收集的服務提供者一般不應該拿來與每週只有一次的服務提供者比較。

##### Comparisons to Targets
##### 與目標比較


Proactive management does more than just comparing current performance after the fact. It motivates better performance and sets goals (through performance targets). By comparing performance to targets defined beforehand, management is acting by making a statement about the performance level that is desired. Targets, if they are reported publicly, are a commitment to your citizens.

主動管理必須比「把當前績效打個分數」還要更多。重點在於推動績效改善以及(透過短程績效目標)設定長程目標。藉由將績效結果與先前設定的目標做比較，績效管理才能基於預期的績效水準與落差採取適當的行動。「目標」一旦公開的報告，便是對市民的承諾了。

Both temporal and inter-jurisdictional comparisons inform the setting of targets. Anticipated changes in your workload, changes in resources available for the service, and your managerial initiatives, do this as well. To complete the performance improvement cycle, the performance measures are compared to these managerial targets, and the differences are analyzed and reviewed to initiate the third step of the performance management process, which is learning what can be done.

時間比較和跨區比較都改變目標設定。工作量的預期變化，服務可用的資源改變、和管理措施都有一樣的效果。要完成績效管理的循環，績效量測必須和這些管理目標做比較，其落差也需被分析和檢討，才能啟動績效管理的第三個流程：學習如何進步？

#### Learn
#### 學習

The next step is discovering what you can do, based on your measures and comparisons, in order to achieve improvement. If you have set managerial targets, the stage is set to learn, particularly in areas (and for measures) where the targets have not been achieved. The management team for each service area learns through internal discussions of the expectations versus the actual performance. Were the expectations inappropriate? Were expected resources not available? Did conditions change unexpectedly? Is something else required that has not been accounted for?

下一步，是基於你的績效和比較來探索你可以做些什麼來達成進步。如果你已設定了管理目標，該階段是在設定為特定某些未達目標績效領域的學習。每個服務區的管理團隊透過內部討論績效差異來學習。期望是合適的嗎？所需的資源到位嗎？條件是不是發生不預期的變化？是否還有其他需求沒被考慮到？

The review by a management team is very important and can keep performance on track, accessing just the knowledge of that team, but if you are benchmarking against other jurisdictions, you may be able to learn techniques and approaches that the internal team cannot envision. Technology has started to improve the effectiveness of this external learning, but there is even greater potential. We have seen the acceleration of the ability to spread improved techniques through email listservs of a community of colleagues, but the potential offered by combining context-specific data with social networking technologies offers the promise of practical and efficient capabilities to learn from others.

管理團隊的檢討的重要性在於確保績效表現照著規劃走。更進一步，如果不只依靠內部團隊的知識，而向其他地區學習，你才能學到其他技巧或方法論。科技已經開始強化這種外部學習的成效，但還有更大的空間。例如：社區或大學內透過電子郵件來快速散播改進技巧，但如果能把實際資料和社群網路結合在一起散佈，更能可靠地提供這些務實的同儕學習。

### Towards Performance-Based Collaboration
### 邁向基於績效的協同

At Revelstone, we built an online performance platform, Compass, with these three elements of the performance management challenge in mind—measure, compare, and learn. We think tools like this, which allow cities to collaborate through performance benchmarking and peer-to-peer learning, are the future of the government-to-government movement. When we first embarked on this journey of performance-based collaboration, we expected that municipal leaders would want to see how well they were doing in comparison to others. However, we assumed they’d be reticent to expose themselves and, therefore, would want to participate in the process anonymously.

在Revelstone，我們其於評量、比較、學習這三項績效管理的挑戰建立了一套線上績效平台 - Compass。我們認為透過這套平台讓城市間透過績效標桿及相互學習進行協同，是政府對政府運動的未來。當我們初次踏上其於績效的協同合作這條路，我們預期各城市的領導者也想看看他們的表現在其他城市間排名如何。然後，我們一開始以為他們不會想把自己的表現公開，因此會傾向以匿名的方式參加。

To the contrary, we discovered a specific desire for people to identify themselves on the platform, so that they could identify like peers, initiate connections, and build learning-based relationships with each other. So, we built a feature in our product that allowed each participating entity to opt out and remain anonymous. Much to our surprise, to date, not a single user of Compass has chosen to participate anonymously; they all want to be part of the collaborative community. Clearly, our skepticism about the willingness of government leaders to share their performance results—at least with each other—was largely unfounded. Is it possible we are seeing this phenomenon only among early adopters of this technology and approach (i.e. selection bias)? Sure, but we are hopeful they will set the trend for the rest of the mainstream market that is sure to follow.

相反地，我們發現其實人們對於在平台上被辨識出來有一種特殊的渴望，他們想被同儕認出來、產生連結、建立互相學習的關係。因此，我們在產品中加入了一個功能讓每個參與者可以自己決定要不要匿名。出乎意料的，到目前為止，Compass上還沒有一個使用者選擇匿名使用。他們全都想成為這個協同社群的一份子。顯而易見，我們對於政府或領導人是否願意公開分享其績效成果是一種毫無根據的臆測。因否這個現象只出現在這類科技和方法論的早期實驗者(也許是因為受測者的偏差)？這是有可能的，但我們很希望他們能為未來的主流市場設下一個理所當然的榜樣。

Will the need for improved performance drive local government leaders to expose their data to the public, or will the open data movement influence the culture of government to be more transparent and engage with the public to its benefit? Perhaps both. Either way, change is coming. It already has been demonstrated in larger cities, in some cases for decades. Now, advancements in technology are enabling smaller cities and towns to participate in the open data movement as well. These trends are also fostering a virtual community of municipalities that are the forerunners of the gov-to-gov movement. They are collaborating with peers to gain valuable context with respect to their performance and learn from each other to improve. We should expect to see accelerated participation as the viral effect begins to surface: “Hey, you should be doing this too, so I can learn from you and you can learn from me.”

究竟是提高績效的需求驅動地方政府首長公開揭露他們的資料，或是開放資料運動影響政府的文化而主動地透明接觸大眾？也許兩者都是吧。不論如何，改變都已發生。近十數年來，在數個大城市已經看到實例了。如今，科技的進步讓小型的城鎮也得以參與開放資料的運動。這些趨勢也在先行城市間孕育了一個政府對政府的虛擬社群。它們彼此合作來獲取和績效有關的高價值資料脈絡，並互相學習、進步。我們可以預見病毒式擴散開始後的加速發展：「嘿，你也應該加入我們，那我們才能一起向對方學習。」

It is time for cities to embrace openness, transparency, and engagement, create a closer relationship with their citizens, and help improve their quality of life. In order to maximize impact, they should leverage each other in the process, taking advantage of the power of the network to drive learning, collaboration, and improved outcomes for all. The open data movement is here. “It’ll shake your windows and rattle your halls.”

是時候讓城市擁抱開放、透明和與市民進一步接觸並建立更緊密的關係，以促進市民的生活品質了。為了讓衝擊最大化，他們應該在過程中互相借勢，運用網路力量的優勢來加速學習、協同和改善成果。這就是開放資料運動。「它將震動民眾的窗戶、撼動市政大廳。」
