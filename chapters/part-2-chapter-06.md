### Introduction

My brother Mike and I never set out to become “civic entrepreneurs.” We did not see ourselves as being a part of the “open government” community. We were simply trying to solve a real-world problem, and that problem required improving the interfaces to government data. In this way, I think our story is the story of many civic entrepreneurs.

我哥哥麥可和我一開始從未想過成為「公民創業者」，我們並沒有覺得自己是「開放政府」社群中的一份子，我們只是試圖解決現實世界裡的問題，而這些問題需要和政府資料介接才得以改善。我想我們的故事就是很多公民創業家的故事。2007年秋季時，我們還很年輕（麥可26歲，我24歲）、具企圖心，想對這個世界帶來一些影響。 

In the fall of 2007, we were young (Mike was 26, and I was 24), ambitious, and looking for a way to make an impact. We had just started an investment advisory company called Alfred Capital Management. We were managing money for individuals and families in San Diego and working hard to build the company client by client.

當時我們剛創辦了一家叫做「艾弗瑞德資產管理」的投資顧問公司，我們為聖地牙哥的家庭或個人管理資產，努力地拓展客戶。 

A few months prior, our father, Mike Alfred Sr., had introduced us to one of his clients, Dan Weeks, who was an engineering manager at Hewlett-Packard (HP). He had hired our father for some legal advice related to his real estate properties. Dan presented a business plan to Mike and me that attempted to solve a problem that he and his HP colleagues were struggling: building sound investment portfolios within their HP 401(k) plans. It was clear that Dan was incredibly passionate about 401(k) investing. Mike and I liked his engineering background, but we did not think the idea was viable at first.

幾個月前，我們的父親－麥可．艾弗瑞德一世，將一位在惠普擔任工程經理的客戶－丹．偉克斯介紹給我們，我父親是他房地產物業的法律顧問。丹向麥可和我提出一個商業計劃，一個他和惠普同事想努力解決的問題：就是如何在惠普401(k) 退休福利計畫中發展健全的投資組合。很顯然地，丹對於401(k) 投資計畫具有令人難以置信的熱情，麥可和我喜歡他的工程背景，但一開始我們不認為他的想法具有可行性。 

Through a series of brainstorming sessions over the following weeks and months—most involving a few whiskeys—the possibility of working with Dan to improve retirement plans took on a new life. These sessions turned out to be where BrightScope began to take shape. We felt we had what could be a big idea. By individually rating every company retirement plan in the US, we believed we would drive an overall improvement in the ability of Americans to retire. It was an ambitious goal, the impact of which would reach far beyond our current client base—and that appealed to us.

接下來的幾個月內，透過一系列伴隨著威士忌的腦力激盪會議中，我們和丹的共同努力讓退休改善計劃有了新契機。也就是這些會議讓後來的BrightScope公司成形。我們有個很大的夢想，若有機會去評量美國內所有個別公司的退休計劃，可能可以全面改善美國人退休狀況，這是一個極具企圖心的目標，其影響將遠遠超出我們目前的客戶群，就是這點吸引了我們。

Defined contribution (DC) plans are a relatively new addition to the corporate retirement plan landscape, rising out of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as an elective retirement savings program for employees. Originally DC plans were thought of as supplemental to company-sponsored, defined benefit (DB) pension plans, but over time, the DC plan firmly supplanted the DB plan as the primary retirement savings vehicle for American workers. As a result, there has been a major shift in retirement responsibility from employer to employee. In a DB plan, the company makes the contributions and the investment decisions, but in a DC plan, these two responsibilities fall squarely on the shoulders of employees. Unfortunately, most employees lack the discipline to save enough for retirement and the skill to build a well-diversified portfolio.

確定提撥（DC）制度是原企業退休計劃外的新範疇，在1974年的員工退休收入保障法（ERISA）中被提出，作為員工退休儲蓄計劃。最早確定提撥計劃被認為是確定給付（DB）養老金計劃下，由企業負擔的附加計畫，但隨著時間演變，確定提撥計劃已取代確定給付計劃，成為美國勞工主要的退休儲蓄工具。

因此，退休福利的責任歸屬產生重大轉變，由雇主移轉到員工。在確定給付計劃中，公司負責投資決策與投資貢獻；但在確定提撥計畫中，這兩個責任則落在員工的肩上。不幸的是，大多數員工缺乏為退休生活儲存足夠的財富的紀律，以及缺少建立多元化投資組合的技巧。 

As we researched these structural issues, we uncovered other problems with DC plans. We found voluminous literature on high retirement plan fees, articles about conflicts of interest between plan service providers and plan participants, and a general feeling that DC plans were not being operated in the best interest of participants. At that point, we knew the opportunity was not solely helping participants make smart decisions for themselves, but also in defining what makes a DC plan good or bad, so that we could inspire the companies who sponsor the plans to make them better. Our objective of helping millions more retire in dignity was really a big data problem, and the first step was tracking down the right data.

在研究這些結構性問題時，我們發現了確定提撥計劃的其他問題。我們發現了大量關於退休計劃高費用的文獻、退休計劃的服務供應商與參與者間利益衝突的文章，以及確定提撥計劃並沒有站在參與者最佳利益來經營等問題。

從這點看來，我們認為機會點不僅在於幫助參與者為自己做出明智決定，還可定義出影響確定提撥計畫成果好壞的因素，這樣我們就可以激發那些贊助退休計畫的企業，使他們提出更好的規劃。這個可以幫助超過百萬退休族的目標真的是和「巨量資料」有關的問題，我們要做的第一步就是追查正確的資料。 

The search for data quickly led us to the Department of Labor (DOL). Every retirement plan in the country files a Form 5500 annually with the DOL. Think of the Form 5500 as a tax form listing the assets, contributions, fees, and other details of each employee benefit plan. Larger plans, those with more than a hundred participants, are also required to obtain an annual audit. The combination of Form 5500 and the audit reports represented a gold mine of information, but first, we would need access to the data, which would require interfacing with the federal government.

勞工部(DOL)是我們第一個要去找資料的機構，全國每一個退休計劃，都需填寫勞工部的5500表格。5500表格中包括列入稅賦計算的資產明細、捐款、費用，以及每個員工福利計劃的相關細節，超過百人的大型計畫，還需要進行年度審計。5500表格和審計報告的結合就像是蘊含著金礦的資訊，但首先我們必需要能取得資料，而這就需要與聯邦政府接頭。 

The data we were looking for was not available through the DOL website. A few data companies were selling the 5500 data, but they did not have the additional high-value data from the audit reports. The decision was made to visit the DOL’s public disclosure room to ask for the data in person. At that point, we did what any entrepreneur would do in our position: wrote a business plan, raised a little bit of money from friends and family, and booked a flight to Washington, DC.

我們所需的數據無法從勞工部的網站取得，雖然有些資料公司會販賣5500表格內的資料，但他們卻沒有審計報告中額外的高值化資料。 因此我們決定親自去拜訪勞工部資料公開揭露室要資料，在這一點上，我們做了一件和我們相同狀況的創業家都會去做的事：寫一份營運計畫書，從朋友和家人募了點錢，預訂了飛往華盛頓的班機。 

As it turned out, this was the beginning of our path to civic entrepreneurship with BrightScope. Though we never intended to build a business around “open data” and “open government,” that was precisely what we were about to do.

後來證明，這就是我們發展BrightScope公民創業的開端。雖然我們從來沒有打算圍繞著「開放資料」或「開放政府」來建立我們的事業，但這卻恰好是我們即將要做的事。

### When “Public Disclosure” Is Not Enough
### 當『公開揭露』不夠時 

Showing up at the Department of Labor for the first time was definitely a culture shock. We had been to DC several times before, but mostly to visit the monuments as students. We had never been to DC “on business.”

I do not think you can overstate the difference between startup culture and federal government culture. Startups are all about speed—fast decisions and rapid development. In DC, you get a sense that everything happens slowly, and every decision is placed under the microscope. The professional staff at the DOL took their work very seriously, but they were held back by a lagging technology infrastructure and years of working through a slow bureaucracy to get work done.

在勞工部的第一次出席絕對是一個「文化衝擊」，我們以前到過華盛頓特區幾次，但主要是以學生身份參觀古蹟，從來沒有為了「業務洽談」去那兒。我認為你絕不會過份誇大創業文化和政府文化之間的差異性，創業就是拚速度：快速決策與快速開發。然而在華盛頓特區，你會覺得一切事物都緩慢發生，每一個決策都要放在顯微鏡下放大檢視。勞工部的工作人員十分嚴謹地面對工作，但他們卻被落後的技術基礎建設，與遲鈍的官僚組織拖住他們的腳步。

We made our way through DOL security, and the staff directed us toward the public disclosure room. The public disclosure room itself is not much to speak of. It is a small, windowless room covered on two sides with bookcases filled with administrative staff manuals, advisory opinion letters, meeting minutes from advisory board meetings, and a whole host of other items that might be of interest to the public.

當我們通過勞工部的安檢措施，工作人員引導我們走向公開揭露室(Public Disclosure Room)時，房間本身沒有什麼好提的，一個小小的房間、沒有窗戶、兩側擺滿了行政人員手冊、諮詢意見書、顧問委員會會議記錄，以及一堆民眾可能有興趣資料的書櫃。

A desk lined the left wall upon entering. What appeared to be a 1990s-era IBM PC running a custom DOL version of MS-DOS sat on the desk. It was difficult to use and looked to be gathering dust. While this was the “public disclosure” room, we personally could not imagine many members of the public visiting the room, so the state of the computer did not surprise us.

進入房間後左側牆邊有張桌子，桌上有一台看來像是90年代時期的IBM個人電腦，裡面運作著早期為勞工部客製化的MS-DOS版本。這真的超難用，上面還佈滿了灰塵。雖然這裡叫做「公開揭露室」，但我們不認為有多少民眾參觀過這裡，所以這台電腦的狀況也沒有讓我們覺得太驚訝。

By this point, Mike had realized that we would need to get some assistance from the DOL staff in order for this trip to be successful, so when an employee entered the room, he engaged him in casual conversation. Before long, both of us were standing behind the desk, looking over the staffer’s shoulder as he dug through the DOL database in search of the documents we described.

麥可知道，這次行程要順利，就需要勞工部工作人員的協助，因此當工作人員進入房間時，麥克開始和他聊天。沒多久，我們倆站在工作人員後面，看他從桌上電腦進入勞工部資料庫中搜尋我們所需要的文件。

After thirty minutes of searching, we found what looked like an audited financial statement for the first company we had been looking for. After confirming that the document was in fact open to public inspection, we printed a copy. We repeated this process for ten to fifteen companies, so that we could ensure that the data was consistently available. We ended up leaving with audit reports from some of the companies with the largest retirement plans in the US, including IBM and HP, as well as some smaller companies that our friends worked at—Google and Facebook. We were informed that the reports would cost fifteen cents a page, which we agreed to, and left the DOL feeling buoyed by the fact that the data existed to accomplish our goals.

三十分鐘後，我們找到一份看起來像是我們一直在找的某公司審計報表。在確認該文件是可開放公眾查閱後，我們影印了一份。我們重複這個過程，又找到了十到十五家公司，以確保這類資料有持續蒐集且符合我們可用的。我們找到了幾家美國大型退休計劃公司的審計報告，其中包括IBM和惠普，也找了一些規模較小的公司，例如：我們的好友－Google和Facebook的資料後結束了這趟行程。工作人員告訴我們，這些報告每頁需要付15美分，我們同意了，而且也讓勞工部覺得這些文件就是我們所需要的。

Our initial excitement about the data was quickly replaced by frustration. Upon returning to San Diego and working our way through the first fifteen plans, we did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation that with sixty thousand audit reports, an average of fifty pages per report, and a cost of fifteen cents per page, it would cost roughly 450,000 dollars to obtain the complete dataset for a single year. To top it off, the DOL clearly had no way to provide the reports to us in bulk, as evidenced by the manual way in which the DOL staffer had printed the first fifteen reports for us. There were also procedural hurdles. While the DOL instructed filers to avoid putting personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers, on the filings, they would occasionally still find filings with this information and have to redact them. While these redactions were rare, they still caused the DOL to create a policy of manually inspecting every printed page before providing the printed reports to the public.

我們一開始取得文件的興奮很快就被沮喪所取代，回到聖地牙哥後，我們利用這十五份報告開始分析，我們快速的做了個簡要計算：若要取得一年內六萬份完整的審計報告，平均每份報告50頁，而每頁15分的成本來計算，將花費大約45萬美元。最糟糕的是，根據勞工部工作人員用人工印出的十五份報告來看，顯然他們也沒有辦法提供散裝報告給我們。

除此之外還有程序上的障礙，勞工部規定，為避免洩露個人身份資訊（Personally Identifiable Information, PII），例如：社會安全號碼，部份檔案中包含了此類資料，所以他們必須重新編寫，雖然需要編寫的比例十分少，但勞工部仍訂出在提供民眾文件前需人工逐頁檢查的規定。

With little to lose, we put together a list of the sixty thousand plans for which we needed data and filed a formal FOIA request. Within a few weeks, we found ourselves on a call with the DOL FOIA staff. We were told in no uncertain terms that our FOIA request was one of the most onerous requests they had ever received. In hindsight, given their limitations at the time, this assessment seems fair. However, when data is the only thing standing in the way of building a business, it is not what you want to hear.

我們列出了一份包含六萬家公司退休計劃相關資料的清單，並提出一份正式的申請。幾星期後，我們收到勞工部工作人員的電話，他們清楚地表示，我們所提出的要求是他們有始以來收到的最嚴酷的要求。以當時環境的限制條件看來，這樣的說法似乎是合理的，但當你只能靠這些資料來創業時，這絕不是你想聽到的。

We managed to work out a compromise with the DOL in which they would print out hundreds of audit reports at a time, put them into boxes, and ship them to us. It was not a sustainable system, but using that approach, we collected enough data to produce our ratings and launch our initial DC plan ratings to the public—and thus, our company BrightScope became a reality.

我們和勞工部設法找出一個中庸之道，他們會分次影印，每次印出幾百份審計報告寄給我們。這不是一個永續性的系統，但透過這種方法，我們至少收集了足夠的資料來進行評量分析，公開發表我們對確定提撥計畫的初步想法；因此，我們成立了新公司- BrightScope。

### From Adversaries to Partners
### 從對手到合作夥伴 

If forced to select a single term to define our relationship with the DOL up through early 2009, the word “adversarial” would certainly be appropriate. We were asking for data that was nearly impossible for the DOL to deliver without some fundamental procedural change investment in technology, yet we would not accept no for an answer.

如果一定要用一個詞來形容當時我們和勞工部的關係，「對手」肯定是最適合的。我們所提出的要求，對於沒有事先投資在改善流程相關科技的勞工部而言，這幾乎是不可能的，但我們無法接受「不」的答案。

That status quo of shipping boxes was still in place at the time we launched our public website. After initially choosing a launch date of January 19, 2009, we were wisely counseled to push back a week so we would not get lost in the news cycle of incoming President Barack Obama, whose inauguration was set for January 20th. The administration change seemed irrelevant to our business at the time, but when President Obama made his first order of business the release of his Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, it grabbed our attention. The memorandum lacked formal teeth, but it was music to our ears:

在我們公開推出網站後，到目前為止我們仍然只能靠每次分批寄來的資料運作。原本我們打算於2009年1月19日推出網站，但因為美國總統歐巴馬的就職典禮是1月20日，為避免網站上市的新聞淹沒於總統就職的新聞中，我們明智地選擇提前一週上市。當時，這種行政上的改變似乎和我們的業務無關，然而當歐巴馬總統在備忘錄上第一次提出「透明與開放政府」想法時，它吸引了我們的注意力，雖然這份備忘錄不具正式的效力，但它卻帶給我們美妙的樂章：

> All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. (Obama, 2009)
> 各行政機構應站在資訊揭露可獲得最大利益的角度，強化他們對資訊自由法(FOIA)的承諾，以迎接開放政府的新時代來臨。(歐巴馬, 2009)


Our business had quickly become heavily dependent on gaining access to public data, but our progress was in fits and starts, surging ahead when a new box of data arrived and then flagging when data was delayed or did not come at all. Almost overnight, we felt a new tune coming out of Washington, a drumbeat of voices intent on making data open, transparent, and accessible, and we felt this could only be good news.

我們的業務高度依賴於公開資料的取得，但我們的進展忽冷忽熱，每當一箱新資料到達時，我們興致勃勃、充滿動力；當資料晚來或根本沒來時，我們就會感到很沮喪。一夕之間，當聽到華盛頓方向傳來政府資訊應透明、公開化、而且民眾可取得的美妙鼓聲，我們覺得這真是個天大的好消息。

While some felt that Obama’s pledge did not cause any change, the DOL, to their credit, began to make steady progress in delivering on opening up their data. What started as the manual printing and mailing of documents transformed into the shipping of external hard drives with thousands of audits. This ultimately resulted in a bulk download utility that was accessible around the clock directly from the DOL website. We went from being constrained by data to having all of the data at our fingertips.

雖然有些人認為歐巴馬的承諾並不會帶來任何改變，然而勞工部為了維持他們的信用(credit)，開始穩定地提供開放資料。不知何時開始，過去人工列印的報表，轉變為儲存著幾百份審計報表的硬碟；現在我們可以直接在勞工部的網站批次下載。我們從過去取得資料的困難狀況到目前資料已隨手可得；此時，我們的公開評量業務開始正式且持續地運作。

Meanwhile, our public ratings had begun to get serious traction. We received numerous write-ups in the *Wall Street Journal*, the *New York Times*, and other mainstream media, and the traffic to our 401(k) ratings pages was on an upward arc. Starting with just eight hundred plans rated at launch, we had reached fifteen thousand plans by October and thirty thousand plans by the end of December. To process this volume of documents, we brought on new engineers and hired and trained a team of data analysts. Our team quickly expanded from fewer than ten at launch to thirty by the end of the year.

包括華爾街日報、紐約時報等許多主流媒體皆報導過我們，我們的401(k) 評量網站的流量亦持續增加。從剛推出時的800份退休計劃評量，十月份達到一萬五千份，12月底時已達到三萬份。為了處理這麼大量的文件，我們聘雇了新的工程師，並培養了一批資料分析師，我們團隊從一開始的十人小組，到今年年底已迅速擴大到三十人。 

Our relationship with the DOL has transformed over the years. We have spent a tremendous amount of time with DOL staffers and political appointees, who have always taken time out of their busy schedules to meet with us when we are in town. The relationship was facilitated by open government events, which allowed for more casual interaction and discussion of big picture objectives.

這幾年我們與勞工部的關係改變了許多，我們花了很多時間與那些願意在繁忙行程中抽出時間的勞工部職員或政務官洽談。透過開放政府的活動，讓彼此在宏大目標下，可以有更多的互動與討論，也因此促進了彼此間的關係。

In November of 2012, our relationship with the DOL truly came full circle. Impressed with the work we had done analyzing the audit reports, the DOL signed up as a BrightScope client and began leveraging the data for a variety of purposes. What started as a contentious relationship has turned into a true partnership, thanks to the DOL embracing an open approach to data.

2012年11月，我們與勞工部的關係有了新的開始。勞工部對我們所做的審計報告分析工作印象深刻，因此簽署合約成為BrightScope的客戶，開始運用資料於各種用途。從一開始具爭議的關係轉變成為真正的夥伴關係，這要歸功於勞工部對資料所抱持的開放態度。

### Finding Comfort in Transparency
### 在透明中尋找舒適

The changed relationship at the DOL is thanks to a combination of a mindset shift on the part of the department and an adoption of technology to solve a business process challenge. They became comfortable with more of their data being open to public inspection, and they started viewing companies like BrightScope as partners in their mandate of safeguarding retirement assets for participants. In some respects, the DOL’s new approach reminds me of the original description of the power of open government described in the influential paper “Government Data and the Invisible Hand” (Robinson, Yu, Zeller, & Felten, 2009). In the paper, the authors describe the limited role of government as requiring and enforcing appropriate disclosure, but stopping short of building interactive websites. This is instead focusing on opening up the data to the public so that the private market can engage with the data and ultimately drive its usage and interaction with the public:

和勞工部關係的轉變，部份來自於該部門的心態轉變，另一方面是因為可運用科技來解決其現有業務流程所面對之挑戰；他們對於公開資料予民眾查閱感到愈來愈安心。此外，他們開始將企業視為其保障退休資產任務的合作夥伴，例如BrightScope。在某些方面，勞工部的新作法讓我想起在「政府資料與看不見的手」（羅賓森、余、柴勒，與費頓，2009）這篇具影響力的論文中，所描繪的開放政府的力量。

> In order for public data to benefit from the same innovation and dynamism that characterize private parties’ use of the internet, the federal government must reimagine its role as an information provider. Rather than struggling, as it currently does, to design sites that meet each end-user need, it should focus on creating a simple, reliable, and publicly accessible infrastructure that “exposes” the underlying data. (Robinson, Yu, Zeller, & Felten, 2009)
> 在文中，作者提到若政府被要求適當的揭露資料，卻沒有建置互動網站時，其作用是有限的；這不僅在於開放資料給大眾，而是讓私人企業或民眾可以運用資料參與或推動與公眾的互動：
為了讓私人企業或民眾可透過網路，利用公共資料帶動創新和活力；聯邦政府必須重新定位其訊息提供者的角色，不用像現在一樣的痛苦掙扎，應設計出滿足終端使用者所需要的網站，把重點放在建立公開、簡單、可靠，且可讓大眾公開造訪的基礎環境。 （羅賓遜、余、柴勒、及費頓，2009）


This way of thinking about government is not new, but it is a fundamental shift from how we traditionally think about government. Asking government to stay focused on data collection and distribution and leaving the building of websites and value-added tools on top of the data to the private sector might seem like chaos to some, but this approach has worked wonders, even within the private sector.

這種思維對政府來說並不是新的觀點，卻根本性地顛覆了過去對政府角色的認知。要求政府針對私人企業的需求，專注在資料的收集、分發、與建構網站，這種要求即便對私人企業而言都會帶來一些混亂，但這種方法卻可帶來非常好的效果。

Open government thinker Tim O’Reilly (2010) describes this phenomenon as “government as a platform.” BrightScope’s plan ratings can be thought of as an “app” on a government platform, leveraging data from the DOL and SEC. Undoubtedly, firms like BrightScope and others will be able to build faster, take more risks, and combine the DOL’s data with third-party data in more new, interesting, and cost-effective ways than the DOL could themselves. So, it makes sense for the DOL to focus on platformizing itself and taking advantage of the entrepreneurial energy and innovations of the private market.

開放政府的推動者提姆•歐萊禮(Tim O'Reilly, 2010) 將這種現象稱之為「政府作為一個平台。」BrightScope的評量計畫可以被視作在政府平台上，利用勞工部與美國證券交易委員會資料所發展出的「應用程式」 (App.)。 毫無疑問，比起勞工部自己，BrightScope或其他業者能夠承擔更多風險，建立更快、更新、更有趣，並更具有成本效益的方式來整合勞工部與第三方所提供的資料。因此，當勞工部將重點放在如何將自己「平台化」 (platformizing)，以獲得來自於私人市場之創業家或創新者的更多創新活力與優勢，是十分合理的。

### Defining Open Data
### 定義開放資料

While BrightScope started with DOL data, as we have grown we have gathered data and information from a variety of public sources, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Census Bureau, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Through the process of identifying high-value datasets and integrating them into our databases, we have encountered all different types of public disclosure. At BrightScope, we are fond of saying that “public” is not a proxy for accessible, usable, or high-value. It is useful, therefore, to describe the best practices of how government agencies and departments currently disclose data and some of the issues their methodologies create. In addition, through this analysis, it is useful to have a common framework with which to evaluate the quality of the disclosure, both in terms of data openness and legal openness.

BrightScope開始與勞工部合作後逐漸成長，也從各種公開管道，包括證券及交易委員會（SEC）、人口普查局、以及金融監督管理局（FINRA）收集各類資料和訊息。透過挑選高值資料，並將其整合到我們自己的資料庫過程中，我們接觸到各種公開揭露的型態。

在BrightScope，我們會說「公開」並不代表可接觸、可使用，或是高價值。唯有當政府行政機構目前所揭露的資料與其對應問題間形成關連性的最佳案例時，它才是有用的。此外，透過這種分析，在揭露資料與其品質評估間建構關連性，無論是在資料開放性和法令開放性時都是很有用的。


### Technical Openness
### 技術開放性

When it comes to technical openness, our first belief is that releasing data in whatever state it is in is better than releasing no data at all. Startups have become remarkably adept at working with data and can usually develop processes to transform disclosed data into whatever form and format they need it in. That said, the lower the barrier to adoption, the more engagement you can generate around the data you are releasing.

提到技術開放性，我們的第一信念就是：無論任何狀態下的資料釋出，都比沒有資料來得好。新創公司擅長在工作中運用資料，發展出將揭露資料轉換成所需之形式或格式的流程。也就是說當資料被採用的障礙愈低，就能帶動愈多參與。

The following framework comes from Cass Sunstein, President Obama’s regulatory czar, and the author of *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness* and *Simpler: The Future of Government*. In a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on September 8, 2011, he describes a simple four-part test he uses to define “smart disclosure:”

以下的論述來自歐巴馬總統的法務大臣－卡斯•桑斯坦(Cass Sunstein)，他是「微調：改善健康、財富和幸福的決策」，以及「簡單：未來的政府」 的作者。亦是2011年9月8日備忘錄中執行機構的負責人，他利用四個簡單指標來定義「智慧揭露」：

> 1. Accessible: Free, online and in bulk

> 2. Machine-Readable

> 3. Standardized

> 4. Timely (Sunstein, 2009)

> 1.	可取得：免費、可批量提供、可線上取得
> 2.	機器可讀取的格式 
> 3.	標準化
> 4.	及時（桑斯坦，2009）



When we first started working with the DOL, the disclosure failed all four tests. The data was not accessible online; it was not available in machine-readable formats; it was not standardized; and it was certainly not timely due to a nearly two-year delay for processing. However, the new DOL disclosure satisfies two of the four requirements. It is available online, both file by file and in bulk for developers, and it is timely, being published within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of the disclosure being filed. The reports are not machine-readable, unfortunately, nor are they standardized, largely due to the fact that the reports are narrative attachments to a document (the Form 5500), so they still require processing. I would still give the DOL high marks for making the most of what they currently receive, though.

我們剛開始與勞工部合作時，四個指標都不合格。該資料無法透過網路取用、非機器可讀取的格式、沒有標準化、將近兩年的延遲處理更談不上具備及時性。然而，現在的勞工部資料揭露已符合兩點要求：已可透過網路取得、亦可批量提供開發者、在申請後的24到48小時即可取得。可惜的是，這些資料還不是機器可讀取的標準化格式，主要是因為這些報告僅是文件檔的附件（例如：5500表格），所以仍需再處理。然而，即便如此，在勞工部已充分利用他們所收到的資料而言，我仍給予其高度評價。

### Legal Openness
### 法令開放性

Even once data is technically accessible, it must be open from a legal standpoint for it to be truly “open.” The “Open Definition,” as defined by the Open Knowledge Foundation, is perhaps the standard in defining legal “openness” as it relates to data and content. Their definition is simple:

即使已具技術可行性，然而要談到真正的「開放」，必須從法律角度來看亦是開放的。開放知識基金會 (Open Knowledge Foundation) 對「開放」的定義和資料與內容有關，或許可為「法令開放性」下一個標準註解。其定義很簡單：

Opening up data in this way, so that there are no limitations on use, reuse, and redistribution, can be tough to stomach for those with data. Some organizations with important consumer disclosures that they place on the web put strict legal limitations with how the information can be used. One example of this is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA operates BrokerCheck, a website that provides tools for consumers to research brokers and broker-dealers. The BrokerCheck website has a prominently placed legal notice making clear its “closed” legal stance:

這種定義下的資料開放，在使用、重用與再發布上完全沒有限制，但對於那些擁有資料的人而言可是會感到胃痛。因此一些擁有消費者重要資訊的組織，即便在網站上揭露資訊，依然會在網頁註明使用該資料時的嚴格限制法律條文。一個例子就是金融監督管理局（FINRA）。金融監督管理局FINRA所經營的BrokerCheck網站，提供消費者研究經紀人與經紀交易商的工具，該網站有一個立場「封閉」的法律聲明： 

> The works of authorship contained in finra.org (the Site), ... may not be copied, reproduced, transmitted, displayed, performed, distributed, rented, sublicensed, uploaded, posted, framed, altered, stored for subsequent use, or otherwise used in whole or in part in any manner without FINRA’s prior written consent. (FINRA)
> FINRA.org（本網站）上的所有內容，......不得複製、轉載、傳播、展示、執行、分發、出租、再授權、上載、張貼、裝裱、修改、儲存供日後使用，或在沒有取得FINRA的事先書面同意下，以任何方式使用全部或部分。（FINRA）

This legal language is against the spirit of open government. While the data is online and technically disclosed, it is not legally open and that distinction is important. It is certainly understandable for an organization like FINRA to have concerns about how their data will be used. Ensuring that data is correctly communicated to and interpreted by the public is an important goal, but if that was the only blocking issue, I think it could be overcome. I fear that organizations like FINRA do not open their data because they are concerned with the potential negative impact. As described by Gavin Newsom in his book *Citizenville*:

這種法律語言違背了公開政府的精神，即使資料可透過網路取得，技術上可揭露，但它仍不具法律上的開放性，這點是非常重要的。我們當然是可以理解，像金融監督管理局這樣的組織，必須關切他們所擁有的資料將被如何使用。確保資料被正確地傳達給公眾，當然是重要的目標，但如果這是唯一的障礙，我認為應該是可以克服的。

我真正擔心的是當金融監督管理局這樣的組織，為了潛在的負面影響而不願開放資料。就像蓋文．紐森(Newsom) 在他的Citizenville書中提到： 

> [Information] often ends up being used against them. Historically, people who request data or information aren’t doing it because they want to solve a problem or create a program. They’re often doing it for political purposes, as a kind of “gotcha government. (Newsom, 2013)
>  [資訊]最終往往被反過來對付他們。從過去經驗看得到，人們申請資料大多不是因為想解決一個問題或建立一種程序，通常只是為了政治目的，作為評批「充滿疑難雜症政府 」的論述 （紐森，2013年）

We in the open data community need to do a better job communicating why the benefits of releasing open data outweigh the potential negative effects. If we fail to make the case, some of the highest value datasets will either be legally closed or hidden from public view entirely, which would dramatically limit the potential of the open data movement.

釋出開放資料的好處遠超過潛在的負面影響，在開放資料社群中的我們需要更佳的溝通能力。如果在這件事上我們讓步了，一些價值最高的資料可能完全無法揭櫫於大眾面前，或是會被封閉的法律聲明所侷限，這將大大地限制了開放資料運動的潛力。

Fortunately, I think many government agencies and departments have been able to clear this hurdle. The DOL undoubtedly had internal questions and concerns about the results of disclosing in a legally open fashion, but even with a small dose of engagement from the developer community, that disclosure has yielded huge benefits. Organizations that publish data under a closed license lose the opportunity to cut their costs and leverage the combined skills and abilities of web-savvy engineers and entrepreneurs all over the world.

幸運的是，目前很多政府機構已經清除此種障礙。在法令開放性的議題上，勞工部無疑地對於資料揭露的方式與結果仍存有許多疑慮和耽憂，然而即便是開發者社群少少的參與，此種揭露即已產生了巨大的效益。那些仍以封閉的法律聲明限制揭露資料使用性的組織，將失去降低成本、或運用來自全球各地善用網路科技、具備工程師與企業家綜合能力的機會。

### Lowering the Barriers to the Next Generations of Civic Startups
### 降低下世代公民創業門檻 

At BrightScope, we spend a tremendous amount of time collecting, processing, and integrating the data we obtain from our government partners. We recognize, like most data companies, that data requires stewardship to ensure that the data quality is suitable for research, analysis, and public consumption. The challenge for a civic entrepreneur accessing data from the government is that, today, too much of their work lies in the behind-the-scenes discovery, cleansing, and matching across datasets and not enough in building the end tools for their users. By promoting data standards, we can ensure that the work we are doing as civic entrepreneurs and the money invested in our mission is funneled into the higher-value work of creating real tools for consumer decisions.

在BrightScope，我們花了大量時間收集、處理、整理那些從政府合作夥伴所得到的資料。我們發現，就像大多數資料公司，這些資料需要適度的管理工作以確保資料品質適合用於研究、分析或公共使用。 對於從政府取得資料的公民創業家最大挑戰是：目前我們花費太多時間與成本尋找藏在資料背後的觀點、尋求資料集間的關聯與確保其正確性，而沒有投入足夠的資源為真正的用戶建構終端工具。透過促成資料格式的標準化，讓身為公民創業家的我們，可確保投資於新創公司的錢都運用到建立價值更高、可協助消費者決策的工具上。

One example of this for BrightScope comes from the DOL filings. In order to calculate all of the fees consumers are paying within their 401(k) plans, we need to include the hard-dollar fees found directly in the Form 5500, as well as the fees coming from the plan’s investment options. This combination of administrative and investment fees becomes what we call “Total Plan Cost.” Fortunately, the investment lineup is contained in the audited financial statement. While the audited financial statement provides a list of investment options, it only requires the name of the investment and not an identification number for it. This makes it impossible to directly link the fund to data on mutual funds that is collected and disclosed by the SEC. As a result, BrightScope spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year parsing out the fund names from the audited financial statement, matching the names to the correct SEC fund ID, and pulling in SEC fund fee data so we can effectively calculate each plan’s Total Plan Cost. Each additional data transformation we make opens the door to introducing errors into our database. If the DOL were to simply require plans to file a standardized schedule of assets with the SEC fund ID, then BrightScope could take the hundreds of thousands of dollars we invest in our current process and invest it higher up the value chain instead. Across the federal government, there are literally thousands of examples where a lack of coordination across agencies and departments leads to lost opportunities to make mash-ups of government data tremendously easier for entrepreneurs.

以勞工部資料申請案為例，為了計算消費者花費在屬於他們的401（k）退休計劃中的費用，我們需要統計表格5500中的直接成本，以及投資選擇的費用。這種包含行政與投資費用的總合就是我們所說的「計劃總成本」。

幸運的是，投資標的都包含在審計過的財務報表中；該報表內有提供投資標的名稱，但卻沒有識別號，所以沒辦法直接連接到美國證券交易委員會(SEC)所收集與揭露的共同基金資料。因此，BrightScope每年需花費數十萬美元從審計過的財務報表中解析出基金名稱，再對應到美國證券交易委員會(SEC)基金的識別碼，並列出美國證券交易委員會基金費用的資料，這樣子我們就可以有效地計算出每個方案的總計劃成本。

每一次額外的資料轉換，就多了一次讓錯誤資料進入我們資料庫的可能性。如果勞工部能提出讓美國證券交易委員會基金資產標示標準化的時間表，則BrightScope就可以將投資於目前程序中的數百萬美金，轉而投資到提昇價值鏈價值的發展上。在整個聯邦政府中，有成千上萬類似的例子，因為缺乏跨機構與跨部門協調，無法為創業者創造便利，導致喪失了政府資料整合可帶來利益之機會。


A more prominent example of this phenomenon is all the data released every year across state and federal governments about individual companies. Information about their earnings is available from the SEC; information about their retirement plans are available from the DOL; information about their lobbying activity is available from the Senate Office of Public Records; information about their environmental record is available from the Environmental Protection Agency; and information about federal contracts they have won is available from the General Services Administration. Yet, there is no easy way to link all of these datasets together.

這種現象另一個比較顯著的例子是：每年透過州政府和聯邦政府發布了個別公司的所有資料。美國證券交易委員會有他們的收入資訊、勞工部有他們的退休計劃資訊、參議院辦公室的公共記錄中有他們的遊說活動資訊、環保局有其關於環境記錄資訊、總務管理局(General Services Administration)則有他們得標之政府合約。然而，目前還沒有連接這些資料的簡單方法。

This is actually a broader issue that came to light during the financial crises, in which the debt of failing institutions was hard to track down, and thus, it was difficult for companies to gauge their “counterparty risk.” This difficulty—and the rapidly declining risk tolerance of the firms in question due to liquidity concerns—caused a freeze in the OTC derivatives and, ultimately, the credit markets in which banks and others refused to lend because of concern about their existing exposures. This issue has led to calls from industry for an international Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system in the financial markets. It is designed to handle the hierarchy problem—for example, it is estimated that AIG has over 250 operating subsidiaries and operations in 130 countries. The benefits of LEI are important:

在金融風暴中，倒閉機構的債務很難追回，而且企業不易了解他們的「交易對手風險」，這其實是一個涵括範圍很廣的問題；企業風險承受度會考量流動性而下降，此種困難將導致 OTC 衍生商品停滯，在信貸市場中，銀行及其他金融單位將拒絕放貸。

這個問題引發業界呼籲在金融市場中建置國際法人識別碼（LEI）系統。此系統主要是用來處理法人機構間從屬關係之問題；例如，AIG集團業務遍及130個國家，旗下擁有超過250間子公司，國際法人識別碼的好處是很重要的：

> The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) program is designed to create and apply a single, universal standard identifier to any organization or firm involved in a financial transaction internationally. Such an identifier for each legal entity would allow regulators to conduct more accurate analysis of global, systemically important financial institutions and their transactions with all counterparties across markets, products, and regions, allowing regulators to better identify concentrations and emerging risks. For risk managers in financial institutions, the LEI will increase the effectiveness of tools aggregating their exposures to counterparties. (The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, 2012)

> 國際法人識別碼（LEI）計劃目的在於對所有參與國際金融交易的任何組織或公司建構一個單一的、通用的法人標準識別碼。這個識別碼可讓監管機構對於跨市場、跨產品或跨地區，在全球重要金融機構中進行交易的所有交易對手進行全球性、系統化、更準確的分析，使監管機構能夠更容易判別風險狀態。國際法人識別碼對於金融機構的風險管理，將增加它們交易對手風險評估工具的有效性。  （存管信託及結算公司，2012）


While LEI is designed to solve a problem in the financial markets, it may also serve the open government community, provided it is either adopted throughout the government or utilities are built that provide mapping from the codes of each individual branch of government to the LEI. This is also not the only approach. Open government advocates, like Beth Noveck (a founder of ORGPedia) and the Sunlight Foundation, have taken the lead on advocating for a better approach, but there is still much work to be done.

雖然國際法人識別碼旨在解決金融市場問題，它亦可協助開放政府社群，針對政府或公營事業各分支機構進行編碼。當然，這並不是唯一方法，開放政府的倡導者，像貝絲．諾薇克（ORGPedia的創始人）和陽光基金會，都已倡導其他更好的方法，但仍有許多工作待努力。

Creating open source standards for identification and linking across datasets is not easy, but with every breakthrough, we lower the barriers to adoption of data for analysis and research. The benefits accrue to open data entrepreneurs and also to the very government agencies and departments tasked with regulating the companies, products, and industries that presently lack standards.

要建立各個資料庫間識別系統與鏈結的開放標準是很不容易的，但我們一次次的突破，降低運用資料進行分析和研究的門檻。期望將利益歸於開放資料的創業家；以及那些負責監管產業、公司、產品，但目前卻仍缺乏標準的政府機構。

### Closing Thoughts
### 結語

While we did not think of ourselves as civic entrepreneurs when we started, our history is really a history of government as a platform and building a business on public data. When we first met and spoke with open government evangelists, like Tim O’Reilly, Jen Pahlka, Alex Howard, Beth Noveck, Laurel Ruma, and countless others, we began to realize how powerful an idea it truly was to provide entrepreneurs with data and access to government. BrightScope is proof that building a viable, for-profit business on top of government data can be a sustainable business model that both benefits government and provides enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs. Now, it is up to the open data community to work to lower the barriers to entry for future civic entrepreneurs.

雖然我們一開始並沒認為自己是公民創業家，但我們的創業歷程卻真的是將政府做為平台，利用公共資料發展業務的模式。當我們第一次和倡導「公開政府」理念的這些福音傳播者，包括提姆．歐萊禮(Tim O’Reilly）、珍．波卡(Jen Pahlka)、亞歷克斯．霍華德(Alex Howard)、貝絲．諾華克(Beth Noveck) 、羅蕊．魯馬(Laurel Ruma)，以及數不清的人；我們開始理解到透過政府資料進行創業是多麼強大的一個想法。

BrightScope證明了透過政府資料建立一個以營利為目的的企業是可行的，不但可為政府帶來利益，亦為創業者帶來永續經營的巨大商業機會。現在，就有賴於來自各地的開放資料社群的共同努力，持續努力為未來的公民創業家降低進入門檻。
